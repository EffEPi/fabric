fabric
======

again.. a new PHP framework

For now is really PHugly, but there are a lot of things that I want to do and implement to allow developers to create site really quick

I am against the idea that a framework should do everything for you, fabric is here to help work with different services/caches without the need to know each command for all the possible libraries.

for example, my goal is to build a db layer like many other framework have, that works for every DB, but do the same for
 - cache
 - shipping address verifications
 - credit card gateways
 - session handlers
 - rss feed creators
 - email libraries
 - etc...

no more writing code for a specific library, but use fabric to write the code that will work for all the supported libraries (not many yet)
